/*
In the front end, a form has been filled in by a hiring manager,
specifying the position they are hiring for, the company they are representing and their email.
We are using RestAPI to request this information.
In the function, we take this and encrypt it into a /apply link, which the hiring manager
posts on their website. We send this link back, probably directly on the front end.
If that turns out harder than imagined, however, we can also send it to the email
